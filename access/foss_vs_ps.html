            <b style="font-size: 105%">Open Source Software</b><br>

            <p>The term open source refers to something people can modify and share because itd design makes it publicly accessible.</p>

            <p>In the context of software development, open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Source code is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it is the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software program works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.</p><hr>

            <b style="font-size: 105%">Closed or Proprietary Software</b><br>
            <p>Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it can modify it and maintains exclusive control of it. People call this kind of software proprietary or closed source software.</p>

            <p>Only the original authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software. And, in order to use proprietary software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license displayed the first time they run the software) that they will not do anything with the software that the software's authors have not expressly permitted. Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop are examples of proprietary software.</p><hr>

            <b style="font-size: 105%">Personal Observation</b><br>
            <p>Paul Ramsey's talk on "The Unknowns: A Manager's Guide to Open Source" at the 2012 Texas GIS Forum, supports my observation that open source software often has a lower feature counts (that is default functions) than proprietary software. However, on the bright side of things, open source software users have the flexibility to share and modify the source code or add extra features to the software without violating any software liability rights.</p>

            <p>Usually, open source software connects well with proprietary software to create a better adaptable system. A good example is integrating Python with ArcGIS. Python is an open source high-level programming language and ArcGIS is a proprietary GIS software protected by ESRI's license liability rights. Some GIS geoprocessing tasks are better performed with Python when the scripts or lines of codes are run within or outside of ArcGIS's user interface.  This kind of combination provides a more effective hybrid system that benefits from the synergetic integration of the two software packages.</p><hr>
